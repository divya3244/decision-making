Ask a user for their birth year encoded as two digits (like "62") and for the current year, also encoded as two digits (like "99"). Write a program to find the users current age in years.
Input format:
Input consists of 2 integers
The first integer corresponds to the last 2 digits of the birth year
The second integer corresponds to the last 2 digits of the current year
Output format:
Print the user's current age
Refer below sample output for formatting.
Sample Input:
62
00
Sample Output:
38


answer:
birth_year = int(input("Enter the last 2 digits of your birth year: "))
current_year = int(input("Enter the last 2 digits of the current year: "))

if birth_year <= current_year:
    age = current_year - birth_year
else:
    age = (100 - birth_year) + current_year

print(age)

output:
Enter the last 2 digits of your birth year:  24
Enter the last 2 digits of the current year:  2024
2000
